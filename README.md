# Personal Portfolio
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c5f8338f-d0de-4199-b47f-25366e7b6418/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/thuinanutshell/deploys)

I've been experimenting with many frameworks and layouts for my portfolio and finally ended up with the one I'm most satisfied with. It turned out to be the simplest in terms of technical stack among all 3! 

For the first one, I used Next.js and JavaScript with Excalidraw font, and even though it looks cool, I believe the font is not suitable for most people. Then, I tried an open-sourced framework called Notablog, which takes your Notion notes and makes them into a website. But I feel it's a bit limiting when it comes to designing the layout of different sections. 

Finally, I've decided to go with a simple tech stack: HTML/CSS and JavaScript (with Be Vietnam Pro font <3), and the result is what I'm most satisfied with! **It strikes a balance trade-off between control and aesthetics.** I understand the code inside out and have perfect control over how I want to modify the style or the layout of it.

This iterative process taught me an important thing: most of the time, code is just a means to an end. I don't need to use the most trendy and complex tech if it doesn't serve my needs.
